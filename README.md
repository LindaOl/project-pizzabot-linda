# Pizzabot

## Project Description
- Make a pizzabot, meaning a site where you can order food from a prompted menu
- Practice if and if else statements

## My Approach
- Tested Technigos example to get an idea of what o do.
- Looked at the pre-added code from Technigo and figured out how the alert and prompt worked, by using google and trying it out.
- Made my first prompt and following alert for the customer name
- Planned out how to start the bot, if i wanted more seperated if statements or if nested if statements would work
- Had to google how to make line breaks inside of a prompt
- Started with the first part og the ordering process, and coded the main choice of food type. Moved on once that was working.
- Struggled a bit how to proceed but after some offline pondering and some trying out to code in a few ways I l anded on how I wanted to it.
- Coded and made the bot work step by step.
- Checked for possible consistancy faults with semicolons and usage of symbols
- Noticed that error messages was showing when they wheren't supposed to, and had to deal with that issue.
- Ended up making a function for errors and for every step check for errors before continuing.
- Remade my code piece by piece to make and learn switch statements, saved in the switch.js file

## What Would I Work More On Or Change
- I would probably also have chosen to ask the customer if they wanted small or large meal instead of asking for their age, so they can make that choice regardless of age. But the task wanted an age prompt so I made one.
- Work on better readability and improve the code where I can
